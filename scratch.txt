Feature engineering
===================
categorical (one-hot encode these):
- league_id
- is_cup
- home_team_coach_id
- away_team_coach_id

ideas:
- last_10_games_undefeated (no Ls)
- last_10_games_unstoppable (no Ds or Ls)
- last_10_games_winless (no Ws)
- last_10_games_league_points (Ws == 3, Ds == 1, Ls == 0)
